Perceptron Supervised Learning Algorithm

The Perceptron algorithm is a model of a single neuron. It operates by receiving inputs
from the training data that are then weighted and used in the activation equation. The output
from this equation is put into a transfer function, which generates Perceptronâ€™s prediction. In
my implementation of Peceptron, I included functions for file I/O, for determining accuracy, for
training the weights, and for evaluating the algorithm. My implementation uses a learning rate of
0.01, and runs for 1000 epochs. The average accuracy of my Perceptron algorithm is 86.0%.
